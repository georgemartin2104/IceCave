# IceCave
Procedural Content Generation

This assignment tasked us with creating a procedural landscape, populated with at least 10 objects and 5 settlements.
The area must also fit a theme to do with the underground, I chose a ice cave.

The landscape is built on Unity, and uses a noisemap to generate random terrain for the ground, as well as noisemaps for planes that are used for the roof and walls.
There are penguins who have a script to make them "randomly" wander around the environment, as well as some procedural elements to each of the objects.
This not only includes their location but can include the objects that spawn inside of buildings and the colours of the objects.

To add to the aesthetic of the environment and to hide the spawning of the objects, the player starts inside a lift which lowers them into the environment.

All of the models were created by myself however the textures for the ice were taken from the Unity assets store.

If running correctly, the player should be able to look around until at the bottom of the lift, when they should also become able to move with the W, A, S, D, keys.
The environment should also be very different each time you run the build.
